# wasting no time

Our goal is to try a lot of stuff and create some references to start a project from a agnostic point of view, in other words, without propaganda and favoritism about technologies, just specs and standards.


## projects

### contacts

Contacts is a reference for development stacks.
The main objective is not to directly compare some characteristics such as performance, memory usage or even CPU consumption, but rather to give a general idea of how each stack behaves, its requirements and how they can help in this aspect.


## how to contribute?

At this moment, if there are something that you consider interesting let us know.
We created a space for it at: [our open general discussion](https://github.com/orgs/wastingnotime/discussions/1)
